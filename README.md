This repository contains the code for all the programming tasks to the University of Michigan's  "Applied Machine Learning in Python" course. 

For more information about this course, see:  [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

I've posted the answers here with the intent that it helps with debugging your own. I encourage you not to copy from the resources, but to understand why your code/answers might not have worked. The discussion forums are really helpful, and I recommend asking for help there before using the resources posted here.
